# Requirements Document

## Introduction

FormatForge is an Anthropic Desktop Extensions (.dxt) based MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool that enables seamless conversion between multiple data formats including CSV, Excel (XLS/XLSX), JSON, XML, and Markdown. Users can interact with Claude using natural language to convert files from local or specified paths, with additional data transformation capabilities such as key styling, column manipulation, and filtering options.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to convert files between different formats using natural language commands, so that I can quickly transform data without learning complex command-line tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests "convert this CSV to JSON" THEN the system SHALL identify the CSV file and convert it to JSON format
2. WHEN a user specifies a file path THEN the system SHALL validate the path exists and is accessible
3. WHEN a conversion is requested THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the source file format
4. WHEN a conversion completes THEN the system SHALL return the output file path to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to support multiple input and output formats, so that I can work with various data sources and targets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing input files THEN the system SHALL support CSV, XLS, XLSX, JSON, XML, and MD formats
2. WHEN generating output files THEN the system SHALL support CSV, XLSX, JSON, XML, and MD formats
3. WHEN an unsupported format is requested THEN the system SHALL return an error message with supported formats
4. WHEN format detection fails THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to specify the format explicitly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data processor, I want to apply transformations during conversion, so that I can customize the output to meet specific requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests key style changes THEN the system SHALL support camelCase, snake_case, lowercase, and uppercase transformations
2. WHEN column manipulation is requested THEN the system SHALL support adding, removing, and renaming columns
3. WHEN data filtering is requested THEN the system SHALL support filtering by date ranges, value conditions, and custom criteria
4. WHEN encoding options are specified THEN the system SHALL support UTF-8, EUC-KR, and other common encodings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a file system user, I want to specify where converted files are saved, so that I can organize my data according to my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no output path is specified THEN the system SHALL save the converted file in the same directory as the source file
2. WHEN an output path is specified THEN the system SHALL save the file to the specified location
3. WHEN the output directory doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create the necessary directories
4. WHEN file permissions prevent writing THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the MCP to have appropriate file system permissions, so that my data remains secure while enabling necessary functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP is installed THEN it SHALL request only read_file and write_file permissions
2. WHEN accessing files THEN the system SHALL validate permissions before attempting operations
3. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL return a permission denied error
4. WHEN file operations complete THEN the system SHALL log the operation for audit purposes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an Excel user, I want to work with specific sheets and ranges, so that I can convert only the data I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting Excel files THEN the system SHALL support specifying individual sheets by name or index
2. WHEN no sheet is specified THEN the system SHALL convert the first sheet by default
3. WHEN multiple sheets are requested THEN the system SHALL support converting all sheets or a specified list
4. WHEN cell ranges are specified THEN the system SHALL support converting specific ranges within sheets

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a data quality manager, I want error handling and validation, so that I can trust the conversion process and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid data is encountered THEN the system SHALL provide descriptive error messages
2. WHEN conversion fails THEN the system SHALL preserve the original file and report the failure reason
3. WHEN data validation is requested THEN the system SHALL check for required fields, data types, and constraints
4. WHEN partial conversion is possible THEN the system SHALL offer to continue with warnings or abort the operation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a command-line user, I want to use the MCP through Claude's natural language interface, so that I can perform conversions without memorizing syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN natural language commands are given THEN the system SHALL parse intent and extract parameters
2. WHEN ambiguous commands are received THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions
3. WHEN commands are processed THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback for long operations
4. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL summarize what was accomplished and provide next steps
